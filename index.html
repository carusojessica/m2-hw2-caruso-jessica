<h1>Welcome to my Web Page!</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Jessica and I am learning how to code and construct webpages. View my first webpage with HTML and learn a little more about me!</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p> I have worked in state politics for the last two years. My government affairs experience has shaped me into a passionate and motivated team-player! I thoroughly enjoy working in the political process and witnessing a positive impact on local communities. This line of work has further motivated me to pursue higher-education and increase my knowledge in mass communications. My goal is to continue to broaden my political network and subsequently help as many people as I can.</p>
